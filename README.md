# Hangman
The game Hangman: currently completely text-based as opposed to visually displaying the titular man's grisly demise. Pretty tame. 

<sup>Wait. I guess the 'man' being hanged is *not* the Hangman. 
I guess.. **we** were the hangman all along, huh? (potentially).</sup>

*Anyway*, this is animal hangman; there's a list of over 90 animals for you to guess through, if you so desire. 
Guess them all to become **The Animal Champion**.
